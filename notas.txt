FITNESS FUNCTION: EVALUA LA MANERAEN LA QUE EVOLUCIONA CADA GENERACION. QUE DETERMINA UNA MEJORA ?

[NEAT]

fitness_criterion = how do we select the bird that goes to the next generation. MAX = select the best bird
fitnes_threshold = the fitness value of the bird with the highest fitness score, if we hit this threshold the program stops
reset_on_extinction = if we have a species go extinct do we reset the value?

pop_size is onw of the most important settings

[DefaultGenome]

Every bird is a "Genome"
Every genome has "Nodes"->los circulitos and "Genes"-> conections

activation_mutate_rate = there is a certain percentage to change the activation function. EJ: if this is set to 1. then every generation will have a rnd actiavtion function
activation_options = from which function will the activation_mutate_rate pick the rnd activation function


# node bias options

bias_max_value          = 30.0
bias_min_value          = -30.0

These are the range of the bias values, we don't want a 10 million bias

bias_mutate_power       = 0.5
bias_mutate_rate        = 0.7
bias_replace_rate       = 0.1

how likely this bias can change

# connection add/remove rates
conn_add_prob           = 0.5
conn_delete_prob        = 0.5

How likely are we to add or remvoe a conection

# connection enable options
enabled_default         = True Every connection is active by default
enabled_mutate_rate     = 0.01 There is a 1% chance of a connection to be disabled

feed_forward            = True  We are using a feed forward neural network
initial_connection      = full  We are gona have fully connect layers at start

# node add/remove rates
node_add_prob           = 0.2
node_delete_prob        = 0.2

20% chance of adding a new node or deleting a node

# network parameters THIS IS THE DEFAULT CONFIGURATION
num_hidden              = 0 0 hidden layuers
num_inputs              = 3 3 input neuron
num_outputs             = 1 1 output

species_fitness_func = max #We are gonna take the max fitness
max_stagnation       = 20 #how many generations without increasing fitness, then delete that species1
